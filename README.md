# Personal Passion Project
To graduate as a student 'Digital Design and Development' at Devine Kask, one of the requirements is to create and execute a personal project. This project consists out of a self-chosen subject that has our interest. The only must to this project is that it should be a challenge where we have to educate ourself a new subject: a new coding language, new framework, ...

## Local
My Personal Passion Project is Local. Local will be an WebApp built in React & React Native with a back-end side of Node.js. 
The app definition statement of Local is: an app that easily helps you find local hotspots in new cities.

## The Client
Local is for everyone who likes to explore new cities or old cities but new spots. For everyone that likes to get the best out of their life and won't adjust for less.

## Core Product Statement
There’s nothing more annoying than looking forward to or being on a nice holiday and realizing that you don’t really know where to go-to for the best pizza margarita, mojito-cocktail or idyllic photo-spot. While browsing on sites like TripAdvisor or Google Maps is super time-consuming and often makes you just more desperate after reading 13 contradictory reviews. It just takes the fun out of traveling and makes you feel missing out.

Local would assist you with that. Local will be your personal assistant that will help you find the best spots in town thanks to the local community, your friends and you. Local will give them the chance to easily add, save, filter, discover and even review a new spot. It will be different from other traveling apps since it will be made for and by real people and not businesses that try to undermine each other. Easy in use and personalization will be the main objectives.
The app will also be built by React and React Native and will be available for Android as well as iOS.

My research question for this project will be: "Where can I easily and quickly find hotspots that manage to perfectly fit with what I want and what's the most user-friendly way of taking them with me on a trip".

## Deliverables
As mentioned above, I would make a WebApp built by React and React Native. My first week consists out of discovering and learning more about React Native and the implementation for Android and iOS. I already learned of using the Expo App for testing. NodeJS will be used as a back-end since short research on the web showed me this was the best fit with React Native.

The whole app will be Devine-worthy, hence there will be a nice matching design to the core of the app.
