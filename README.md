# Personal Passion Project

To graduate as a student 'Digital Design and Development' at Devine Kask, one of the requirements is to create and execute a personal project. This project consists out of a self-chosen subject that has our interest. The only must to this project is that it should be a challenge where we have to educate ourself a new subject: a new coding language, new framework, ...

## Neighbourhood

My Personal Passion Project is Neighbourhood. Neighbourhood will be a cross-platform native app build with React Native with the help of React Native Hooks. The app also uses Redux to manage the overall state. The (complicated) Foursquare Places API will be used to fetch data throughout the app.

The app definition statement of Neighbourhood is: an app that easily helps you find spots nearby you thanks to your current location. These spots can be filtered in to categories such as lunch-spots, nightlife-spots, shop-spots, ...

## The Client

Neighbourhood is for everyone who likes to explore new cities or old cities but new spots. For everyone that likes to get the best out of their life and won't adjust for less.

## Core Product Statement

There’s nothing more annoying than looking forward to or being on a nice holiday and realizing that you don’t really know where to go-to for the best pizza margarita, mojito-cocktail or idyllic photo-spot.

Neighbourhood would assist you with that. Local will be your personal assistant that will help you find the best spots in town thanks to the local community, your friends and you.

My research question for this project will be: "Where can I easily and quickly find hotspots that manage to perfectly fit with what I want and what's the most user-friendly way of taking them with me on a trip".

## Deliverables

As mentioned above, I would make a cross-platform native app for iOS and Android. Ideally I wanted to implement a Machine Learning Recommendation System in it to make the recommended spots more personal. After doing thorough research I concluded this wasn't achievable in the amount of time given. I implemented a recommendation system on another database to prove that I understand what is needed for such recommendation system.

The whole app will be Devine-worthy, hence there will be a nice matching design to the core of the app.
